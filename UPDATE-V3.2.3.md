# Announcing a Major Update to the Punch.In Scholar Companion\!

We are pleased to announce a significant update to the **Punch.In Scholar Companion**, a web application engineered to provide students with precise and intelligent tools for academic management. This latest version introduces a fully interactive timetable system alongside a suite of AI-powered features.

Here are the key highlights of the new release:

-----

### 1\. New Interactive & Mobile-Optimized Timetable

At the core of this update is the new interactive timetable. Users can now map out their entire weekly schedule, assigning subjects to specific periods for each day. Understanding the need for on-the-go access, the entire interface has been optimized for mobile devices, ensuring a seamless and responsive experience.

### 2\. Real-Time Daily Dashboard & Instant Punch-In

The timetable you create directly powers the dynamic **"Today's Schedule"** dashboard. Each day, your scheduled classes appear automatically, allowing for one-click **"Punch-In"** to mark a class as attended or bunked. Every action instantly updates your records and recalculates all attendance percentages in real-time.

### 3\. A Suite of Powerful AI-Powered Features

This update goes beyond tracking, introducing several intelligent tools to help you plan smarter.

  * **AI Personalized Study Planner:** Define a goal in natural language, such as *"prepare for final exams in three weeks."* The AI analyzes your class schedule to generate a detailed, actionable study plan that utilizes your free time.
  * **Strategic AI Bunk Planner:** Get AI-powered recommendations on the best days to miss class to create a long weekend, based on your timetable and local holidays.

  * **AI Topic Suggester:** Select a subject from the dropdown menu and get AI-suggested key topics to focus on for your studies, helping you prioritize what's most important.

  * **AI Result Insights:** Receive clear, actionable advice on which specific classes to attend on which days to efficiently improve your attendance and reduce any deficit.

### 4\. Comprehensive Attendance Analytics & Sorting

The **"Attendance Overview"** serves as a central command center, now with more precise industry-standard calculations accurate to two decimal points.

  * **Visual Dashboards:** Each subject is represented by a circular progress bar for an immediate visual status check. A prominent **"Overall"** card provides a brief view of your aggregate attendance.
  * **Advanced Sorting:** Instantly reorder your subject list alphabetically or sort by attendance percentage (ascending or descending) to quickly identify subjects that require immediate attention.
