## Attendance Overview

Immediately upon logging in, students see a clear and interactive visual summary of their attendance across all registered subjects. Attendance data updates instantly and shows:

- **Current attendance percentage** for each subject, so you always know where you stand.
- **Overall trends** illustrated in visual format, helping spot risky attendance patterns early.
- **Color-coded cues** for quick awareness if any subject falls below safe attendance thresholds.

This overview encourages daily accountability and makes it easy to avoid falling short of minimum attendance requirements[1].

PunchIn generates a detailed, calendar-style view of the current week’s classes and events. This feature is more than just a static timetable:

- **Day-by-day breakdowns** of lectures, labs, and tutorials for quick daily review.
- **Automatic highlighting** for today’s classes, so students never lose track of what’s coming up.
- **Streamlined organization** helps spot free slots for study, rest, or extracurricular activities.

It’s the digital version of a perfectly managed student planner—fully automated, clean, and up to date[1].
