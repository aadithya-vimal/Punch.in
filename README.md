# Punch.In - A Strategic AI Attendance Planner

## Live Application: [PunchIn](https://punchin-tracker.vercel.app/)

## About The Project
Punch.In is a smart, cloud-synced web application designed to help students move beyond simple attendance tracking and into strategic academic planning. It provides a comprehensive suite of tools to calculate attendance needs, manage subjects, and receive personalized, AI-powered advice on how to best manage their schedule.

This project was developed as a full-stack application, evolving from a simple concept to a secure, account-based platform with a real-time database and an integrated AI assistant.

## Key Features:
* Cloud-Synced Accounts: User data (subjects, attendance, timetables) is tied to their personal account and synced across all devices using Firebase Authentication and Firestore.

* Comprehensive Attendance Calculator: Four distinct calculation modes to determine exactly how many classes a user needs to attend or can afford to miss to meet their goals.

* At-a-Glance Dashboard: A dynamic "Attendance Overview" provides an immediate visual summary of the user's standing in every subject.

* Customizable Timetable: A clean, intuitive interface for users to set their weekly class schedule, including the number of hours per subject on any given day.

* Strategic AI Bunk Planner: Analyzes your timetable and real-time public holiday data to find the best days to miss class for a long weekend and calculates the "cost" of earning that day off.

* AI Study Planner: Generates a personalized, actionable study schedule based on your subjects, timetable, and a specific goal you provide (e.g., "prepare for mid-terms").

* AI Topic Suggester: Instantly generates a list of key topics and concepts for any of your subjects, helping you focus your study sessions for maximum impact.

AI Result Insights: After performing a calculation, you can now get contextual, AI-powered advice on how to either catch up on your attendance or productively use your free time.
